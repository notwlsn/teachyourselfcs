**Project Study Plan for Learning CS:** (https://teachyourselfcs.com)

**Methodology**: Study all nine subjects below, in roughly the presented order, using either the suggested textbook or video lecture series, but ideally both. Aim for 100-200 hours of study of each topic, then revisit. The week resources are the general outline, and the indented material is what I actually used as I was working through this.
